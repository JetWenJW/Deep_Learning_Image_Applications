This Repo contains lots of Image Operation and trainning AI model.
However,to avoid files are too big, users must train AI model by themselves

Here is how DIR use:

1. The WebCam_Control DIR is all about webcam control and face detection in real time.
2. The Image_Application DIR is base on AI model helping us to do Image Proccess such as Image Generation, Face Genration, Object Detection...etc.
3. The src DIR is generally use about Image Operations, and it also aontains face detections, face recongnitions.
4. The rest of DIR is some Training DataSet and Testing DataSet to train AI model and to validate AI model.
